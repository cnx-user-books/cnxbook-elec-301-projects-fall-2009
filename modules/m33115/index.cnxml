      <title>Our System Setup</title>
      <para id="id14806246">We plan to use the probability mass function (PMF) of 5 different vowel sounds in 3 different languages to determine which language a speech sample is spoken in. However, before we can attempt to carry out that task, we require a means of counting the number of occurrences of the 5 different vowel sounds in any given speech sample to create the PMFs.</para>
      <para id="id12114772">We chose English, Spanish and Japanese to analyze in this project. Spanish and Japanese both have simple vowel sounds. For example, 90% of Japanese speaking consists of the 5 basic vowel sounds in our database. Spanish is similar and English is a little more complicated in pronunciation but we can still find an approximate distribution with our system and database. The choice of these languages has a good representation of western and eastern language and they are all widely used languages.</para>
      <para id="id13577330">Two important databases are crucial in order for the system to perform at this point. One is the formantâ€™s frequency of the 5 most basic vowel sounds (a, i, u, e, o). The other database we want to have is the reference PMF of the 3 languages we are using. If we believe that there is a certain pattern in the PMF of the vowel sound distribution in these languages, then statistically, if we have a large enough sample, the PMF should represent the population parameters. In our case, we decided to use a long speech sample of each language and use its vowel sound PMF as the reference data, which will be used later in the system to match smaller random speech samples.</para>
